        This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is
        collected, used, and shared when you visit or make a purchase from kyden
        (the “Site”).
      </p>

      <p></p>
      <h3>Personal information we collect</h3>

      <p>
        When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information
        about your device, including information about your web browser, IP
        address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your
        device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information
        about the individual web pages or products that you view, what websites
        or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you
        interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically collected
        information as “Device Information”.
      </p>
      <p></p>

      <p>We collect Device Information using the following technologies:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer
          and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For more information
          about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit
          <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank"
            >http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a
          >.
        </li>
        <li>
          “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data
          including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider,
          referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.
        </li>
        <li>
          “Web beacons”, “tags”, and “pixels” are electronic files used to
          record information about how you browse the Site.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Additionally, when you make a purchase or attempt to make a purchase
        through the Site, we collect certain information from you, including
        your name, billing address, shipping address, payment information
        (including credit card numbers), email address, and phone number. We
        refer to this information as “Order Information”.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are
        talking both about Device Information and Order Information.
      </p>

      <h3>How do we use your personal information?</h3>

      <p>
        We use the Order Information that we collect generally to fulfill any
        orders placed through the Site (including processing your payment
        information, arranging for shipping, and providing you with invoices
        and/or order confirmations). Additionally, we use this Order Information
        to:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Communicate with you;</li>
        <li>Screen our orders for potential risk or fraud; and</li>
        <li>
          When in line with the preferences you have shared with us, provide you
          with information or advertising relating to our products or services.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for
        potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more
        generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by generating
        analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and
        to assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).
